AI Agent Architecture Overview (with Example)

1. User Interaction
	•	Process:
	•	The user provides a prompt (a question or task).
	•	The agent processes the input and delivers a response.
	•	Example:
User prompt: “Summarize the latest sales report.”
Agent response: “The total revenue increased by 15%, with the highest sales in the North region.”

2. Agent Core Function
	•	Process:
	•	Acts as the central controller, coordinating tasks between the user, LLM, tools, and memory.
	•	Ensures smooth communication and task execution.
	•	Example:
The agent receives the prompt, decides if it needs to retrieve external data (from tools) or refer to past conversations (from memory), and crafts a response.

3. Prompt Template
	•	Process:
	•	Provides a structured format for the LLM, ensuring consistent outputs.
	•	Includes specific instructions to guide the model’s behavior.
	•	Example:
The agent uses a predefined template:
“Given the user’s question, extract key figures from the latest report and provide a brief summary.”

4. Large Language Model (LLM)
	•	Process:
	•	Handles reasoning and planning, processes natural language, and generates intelligent outputs.
	•	Example:
After understanding the prompt, the LLM interprets the sales report and summarizes key insights.

5. Tools
	•	Process
	•	Perform external actions like fetching data, running calculations, or integrating with APIs.
	•	Example:
The agent uses a data extraction tool to pull information from the latest sales report before summarizing it.

6. Memory
	•	Process:
	•	Stores and retrieves previous interactions for continuity and context.
	•	Example:
If the user later asks, “How does this compare to last year?” the agent retrieves last year’s sales data for comparison.
